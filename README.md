#Drupal Color Styles

Custom module with an admin settings page and ctools panels plugin using jquery colorpicker.

This module is an example of FAPI that uses jquery color picker as a form element. There's also a ctools panels content type plugin that pulls all these settings into a panel pane. The colors the user selects for title and title background are then rendered in the pane.
